# elevate_tech_assessment

a modular Flutter application that demonstrates clean architecture principles, robust state management using BLoC, and modern dependency injection with get_it and injectable. The app features a responsive product listing interface, efficient error and loading state handling, and a scalable structure designed for maintainability and testability. It serves as a practical example of building production-ready Flutter apps with best practices in UI, architecture, and code quality.
